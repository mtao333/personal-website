        <h2>-My Journey-</h2>
        <p>
            First and foremost, Thank you so much for taking the time to read about me and allowing me to tell you a little bit more about who I
            am as a person. I am currently a junior Texas A&M University student studying computer science and mathematics so Gig' em! I will 
            finish my bachelor of science in computer science and mathematics minor in December of 2023 and depending on my work and desire to
            learn it could very well be May of 2024. As of now, I have a standing GPA of 3.7/4.0 and some of my favorite classes that I have 
            taken would be computer systems, a class allowing me to learn more about the operating systems and low-level coding in general, 
            Programming Studios, a class revolving around group coding in which amazing products can be brought to life, and surprisingly
            enough, philosophy, a class with a lot of writing, but it allowed me to freely write my curious expressions down. That class had me 
            leaving the class with more questions and a more curious behavior where I found myself putting "how" and "why" at the end of my thoughts. 
            I am extremely interested in software development having experience with both front-end and back-end. This includes knowledge of 
            Html5, JavaScript, and a bit of React as well as Java, Python, C++, SQL, and VBA. I am also interested in lower-level programming 
            with an emphasis on Linux shells, multithreading, and client-server-side programming. When it comes to version control, I am 
            proficient in git and GitHub desktop. However, aside from all of the skills I am advertising above, I think my most proud one has to 
            be my willingness to learn more. I recognize there is still a vast multitude of things I can still learn, therefore I am still very 
            curious and eager to learn more about what this field can offer. I Would like to describe myself as a hard worker, problem solver, 
            and someone who loves communicating and creating meaningful relationships. <br><br>
            From here on out I would like to tell you all about my journey. It all started on a lovely summer of 2002 when there was a baby not
            looking the greatest after being pushed out prematurely 5 weeks early. Starting rough right off the bat, extremely little Michael 
            Tao managed to push through and start his life. Fun fact, he was so small that when he was being x-rayed they thought he was going to
            be a dwarf, but now he is a healthy 5'10 (5'11 with shoes on)! I lived in Katy all my life with my parents and grandparents and My 
            family means the entire world to me. I was bestowed with a fantastic childhood and I was raised with tender love, effective 
            communication, new experiences, and 4 role models that I still look up to today. That is where I learned the importance of having 
            empathy, being a lifelong learner, being a good listener, and being responsible and kind. I want to continue growing my character allowing
            the world to see that my parents did raise me well, and not only that, I want to continue striving toward greater 
            ambitions so I can look back and say "Thank you, mom and dad, I have made it thanks to you, so now let me take care of you." As I 
            continued growing, I took up many hobbies, and some that I love to partake in nowadays would be Swimming, basketball, weightlifting, 
            concerts that let you experience music like never before, cross-stitching, and even looking to start making my own clothing! 
            A part of me loves going out and doing things, but there's nothing like creating a tranquil atmosphere by playing cards with my 
            grandparents, sitting around and having a good conversation with laughs, and being by yourself participating in self-love. 
            Also, one of my biggest dreams is to travel around the world and engage with breathtaking scenery that is not just my suburbs
            in katy. <br><br>
            Now onto high school. I went to a rather large school called Obra D. Tompkins Highschool and while there were a lot of stressful 
            and tiring moments, it was overshadowed by unforgettable memories, unbreakable bonds, and incredible life lessons. I remember that I
            used to be really shy around my peers, but if there is one thing I overcame throughout high school was my fear of stepping outside of
            my comfort zone. Some of the most exciting times of my life happened to be spontaneous and enhanced by the friends I made along the way
            throughout the years. Whether that be a trip to Galveston, random dinner runs after long grueling swim practice, or just even  
            3 am spontaneous I-Hop feasts. It may be cheesy but I want to thank every single one of my friends and mentors, it meant 
            a lot. To me, one of the most important things I learned throughout high school was the word "Sonder." It quite literally means: 
            the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own, in which you might appear only once, 
            as an extra sipping coffee in the background. Imagine you are driving home from the airport and you see a giant apartment complex building
            with many windows lit up. It is hard to believe, but every one of those windows has someone living their own story. Whether 
            it may be a big job interview, a tired doctor, or even a couple celebrating their honeymoon, they all have something going on. 
            This word means so much to me because every single person has spent years living on this planet and has a story to tell. It helped
            me become a better listener, understand that everyone has something going on for them whether good or bad and allow me to stretch 
            my hand out to introduce myself instead of shyly sitting next to someone for the entirety of a semester without getting to know that person. 
            I believe that nobody is just boring, sometimes you just need someone to listen. I want to take this time to tell every single person
            to take that initiative and step outside of their comfort zone, for you never know what relationship could blossom. It is always the 
            most unlikely friendship that flips your world upside down for the better. This next section revolves around that unlikely friendship 
            I made in high school where I was able to learn so much. That person continues to make me challenge myself and motivates me to be
            better, and not only that, I was able to learn the true meaning of fulfillment and what it means to pursue happiness. 
            Never have I been able to smile continuously and laugh to the point where it feels like time has stopped and you are just in my own little
            bubble. Thanks for being my best friend. All in all, I just want to say, I am not who I am today by myself. I have an amazing group 
            of friends and family that continuously allow me to strive toward my ambitions. I wouldn't be the same person if it wasn't for them
            and I don't think I would like that person either. I am continuing my journey at Texas A&M and working hard toward a life I can look
            back at and say I have made it. It may have been a little bit overbearing and potentially cringy, but thank you for reading and 
            learning a little more about what goes on in my mind! - Michael Tao
