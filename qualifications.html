            I am currently a junior Texas A&M University student studying computer science and mathematics so Gig' em! I will 
            finish my bachelor of science in computer science and mathematics minor in December of 2023 and depending on my work and desire to
            learn it could very well be May of 2024. As of now, I have a standing GPA of 3.7/4.0 and some of my favorite classes that I have 
            taken would be computer systems, a class allowing me to learn more about the operating systems and low-level coding in general, 
            Programming Studios, a class revolving around group coding in which amazing products can be brought to life, and surprisingly
            enough, philosophy, a class with a lot of writing, but it allowed me to freely write my curious expressions down. That class had me 
            leaving the class with more questions and a more curious behavior where I found myself putting "how" and "why" at the end of my thoughts. 
            I am extremely interested in software development having experience with both front-end and back-end. This includes knowledge of 
            Html5, JavaScript, and a bit of React as well as Java, Python, C++, SQL, and VBA. I am also interested in lower-level programming 
            with an emphasis on Linux shells, multithreading, and client-server-side programming. When it comes to version control, I am 
            proficient in git and GitHub desktop. However, aside from all of the skills I am advertising above, I think my most proud one has to 
            be my willingness to learn more. I recognize there is still a vast multitude of things I can still learn, therefore I am still very 
            curious and eager to learn more about what this field can offer. I Would like to describe myself as a hard worker, problem solver, 
            and someone who loves communicating and creating meaningful relationships. <br><br>
