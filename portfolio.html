            <b>Vision | TAMU Robomaster Robotics</b> <br><br>
            | Placed 3rd in 2021 North American Robomasters competition |<br>
            Was a part of a team consisting of 15 dedicated developers trying to develop a robot in under a $3000 annual
            budget.Through Python and experimental datasets, the robot achieved a 96% accuracy when it comes to robot detection.
            Generated a synchronous pipeline for subsystems to communicate. Utilized OpenCV and vector algebra for object
            detection with noise. <br>

            <b>Summer Engagement Program</b>  <br><br>
            Selected by Paycom to join them in sessions to learn and work with them to gain an exponential understanding
            about a technical company's workforce. Got to utilize and observe Git, PHP, React, and SQL. <br><br>
            <b>IHI E&C Engineering Tool Developer </b><br><br>
            Developed software for structural engineers who analyze and design offshore oil & gas platforms and onshore LNG
            terminals. Develop Excel based in house software using VBA. By using given design data we can perform analysis and designs
            increase productivity from 60 - 95 percent. <br><br>
            <b>Kumon: After School Math & Reading Programs | Leadership </b>
            Created a system to track student progress and identify areas of improvement, resulting in an average increase of
            11% in test scores.Developed lesson plans based on each student's individual needs; this increased engagement and boosted
            confidence levels. Regularly communicated with parents about their child's progress. <br><br>
            <b>The transfer of electrocardiogram (ECG) data through a client-server relationship </b>
            Designed a client and server utilizing C++. The server hosts ECG data points of patients. The client side can obtain any data point 
            from the server and obtain a file of any size. Used multithreading to increase operations by 33%. Also utilized TCP protocol 
            and sys/socket so the server and client can reside on different machines <br>

            <b>Aggie Shell</b>
            Utilizing C++ I implemented my very own linux shell. This linux shell in my OS lets a user navigate through the file system 
            and performs a wide variety of tasks using a series of simple commands.This includes command pipelining, cd commands, 
            background processes, etc. <br>
