        <h2>-community-</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my life, there was always a big emphasis on community service. Ever since I was a kid I would be helping around my community
            church kccc! While most kids wanted to go home, I thought it was an excellent time to just hang out with peers while we all set up the 
            event together. After all, if I went home I would have just been by myself regardless. This carried on to high school where I did the bulk
            of my volunteering. Not only did I obtain 120 hours in 4 years through our F.O.R.C.E program, but I also volunteered at least over 100 for our 
            local Chinese orchestra. Through the Force program, I was helping out in the food bank, hospitals, libraries, and carnivals, and honestly, 
            every experience was so unique and I never knew what I was getting into. I enjoyed these new experiences and the connections I made 
            along the way. However, my favorite volunteer has to be the Chinese orchestra. There was a really solid community of elders, adults, 
            and kids my age! While I have had experiences with my culture, I never truly got to embrace it. That is why the Chinese orchestra is such 
            an important community for me. Listening to the Guzheng and Pipa for the first time and talking to the elders in the community is just a something
            I have never really been able to do it before. The most surreal experience has to be when you are on stage getting ready to perform and a blast of music,
            dancers, fireworks, cheering, and peals of laughter ensue. All of that and the fragrant aroma wafting through the air make you feel like you 
            are on a different planet. I had my fair share of bullying and not wanting to go to school because I was Asian, but with every day I spent volunteering
            in that community I was able to learn a bit more about my culture, figure out my identity more, and embrace and love who I truly was. <br><br>
